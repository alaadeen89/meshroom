# Plugin Logic



# Make a plugin

    Install plugin from an url or local path.
    Regardless of the method, the content will be copied in the plugin folder of meshroom (which is added to the list of directory to load nodes from).
    There are two options :
        - having the following structure :
            - [plugin folder] (will be the plugin name)
                - meshroomNodes
                    - [code for your nodes] that contains relative path to a DockerFile|env.yaml|requirements.txt
                    - [...]
        - having a meshroomPlugin.json file at the root of the plugin folder
